  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="description">Hi there! My name is Carrik, 
    and I am a UXUI designer who strives to create products that deliver seamless and intuitive user experiences in an effective manner.

</p>

  <p class="description">
    I received training under the Google UX Design Certificate Course through working on 3 personal projects, which gave me a strong foundation in the design process. Additionally, I worked as a UXUI designer in an Edu-Tech Start-up, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and further refine my skills.

  <p class="description">
    As a tech-savvy individual, I am proficient in utilizing Figma and Adobe XD, and I have a constant eagerness to explore and master new tools. Additionally, I enjoy leveraging the power of AI tools to enhance my workflow efficiency.
  </p>



  <p class="description">
    Furthermore, I have gained hands-on experience in front-end development, as exemplified by this portfolio 
    website I independently developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
    Although it is challenging to build a website from scratch, it is also fun to learn and implement knowledge directly.
